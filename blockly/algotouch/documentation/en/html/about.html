        <p>AlgoTouch is a program learning software for school purposes.
            The goal is to facilitate the understanding of how an algorithm works, by manipulating objects in a "physical" way,
            without having to write a single line of code.</p>

            This implementation, proposed in the form of "blocks" to moved was carried out by 2nd year students of the IUT
            of Vannes as part of their synthesis project.
            It is essentially based on Blockly technology, proposed by Google.

            AlgoTouch is developed by Michel ADAM and Patrice FRISON.</p>
